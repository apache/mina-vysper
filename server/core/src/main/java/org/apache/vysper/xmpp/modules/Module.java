/**
 * a module plugs new functionality into the server, most probably an implementation for a XEP.
 * this functionality spans:
 * <ul>
 * <li>adding services (implementing ServerRuntimeContextService) to the server which can be accessed by other modules</li>
 * <li>doing initializations, for example adding request listeners to the ServiceDiscoveryRequestListenerRegistry</li>
 * <li>adding dictionaries with new stanza handlers getting registered with the server which then get called as
 *     matching stanzas arrive</li>
 * <li>adding dictionaries with new event listeners getting registered with the server which then get called as
 *     matching events are published</li>
 * </ul>
